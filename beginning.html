<h2>the beginning of AI</h2>
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the machine-displayed intelligence that simulates human behavior or thinking and can be trained to solve specific problems. AI is a combination of Machine Learning techniques and Deep Learning. AI models that are trained using vast volumes of data have the ability to make intelligent decisions.

Theoretical work

The earliest substantial work in the field of artificial intelligence was done in the mid-20th century by the British logician and computer pioneer Alan Mathison Turing. In 1935 Turing described an abstract computing machine consisting of a limitless memory and a scanner that moves back and forth through the memory, symbol by symbol, reading what it finds and writing further symbols. The actions of the scanner are dictated by a program of instructions that also is stored in the memory in the form of symbols. This is Turing’s stored-program concept, and implicit in it is the possibility of the machine operating on, and so modifying or improving, its own program. Turing’s conception is now known simply as the universal Turing machine. All modern computers are in essence universal Turing machines.
